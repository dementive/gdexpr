# GDExpr - Scripting Language for Godot 4

Built with godot 4.3 C++ GDExtension

### Distributing your extension on the Godot Asset Library with GitHub Actions:
1. Go to Repository→Actions and download the latest artifact.
2. Test the artifact by extracting the addon into a project.
3. Create a new release on GitHub, uploading the artifact as an asset.
4. On the asset, Right Click→Copy Link to get a direct file URL. Don't use the artifacts directly from GitHub Actions, as they expire.
5. When submitting/updating on the Godot Asset Library, Change "Repository host" to `Custom` and "Download URL" to the one you copied.
